# hi-c
A proper example of "hello world" in C

####Remember:

* The main must **always** return an integer type
* The return value of the main function is the "exit status" of the program.
And on most OSes returning 0 is a success status indicating that "The program ran fine".

#####Compilation

Have gcc or clang. Example for gcc:

`gcc hi-c.c -o hi-c`

#####Execution

`./hi-c`
